1. Running the Arcade Game
In order to run the arcade game. Open a browser and load the index.html file from the github repository located at: https://xicanavilla.github.io/arcade/. The file will load with a game board, enemy bugs that cross horizontally and a player at the bottom of the screen.

2. Playing the Arcade Game
The player in the form of a young boy is your game piece. Your objective is to cross the grassy area in order to make it to the magical river without hitting any of the enemy bugs that cross the forrest. In case that you touch a bug accidentally, you will be returned to the starting point where you can try again. The game ends once you reach the river in which case you can press the "replay" button in order to play again.
